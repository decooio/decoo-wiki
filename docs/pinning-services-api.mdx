Decoo provides a vendor-agnostic [IPFS Pinning Service API](https://ipfs.github.io/pinning-services-api-spec) implementation based on [Crust Network](https://crust.network), which can be directly requested or used through *ipfs pin remote* command set.

:::note
*IPFS Pinning Service API* is deployed in Decoo Cloud. Decoo Cloud automatically selectes an Endpoint for file pinning, you don't need to be concerned with underlying steps like selecting an Endpoint, requesting temporary *access token* from Decoo Cloud to authenticate with the selected Endpoint, etc.

:::

## URL
https://api.decoo.io/psa

## Authentication
The Pinning Services API uses the Bearer Token method for authentication. The API Key is automatically generated when creating an account at [Decoo](https://decoo.io), which could be found at *panel -> API -> API JWT*. You can provide an authentication header using your API Key just like accessing other Decoo Cloud APIs:
```
"Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

## Configuring Decoo in the IPFS CLI
You can also pin to Decoo directly from the IPFS CLI using the IPFS command.

To add Decoo credentials:
```sh
ipfs pin remote service add decoo https://api.decoo.io/psa <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

To pin a CID to Decoo under a human-readable name:
```sh
ipfs pin remote add --service=decoo --name=<FILE_NAME> <CID_TO_PIN>
```

To list successful pins:
```sh
ipfs pin remote ls --service=decoo
```

To list pending pins:
```sh
ipfs pin remote ls --service=decoo --status=queued,pinning,failed
```

For more commands and general help:
```sh
ipfs pin remote --help
```
