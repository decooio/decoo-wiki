## URL

```
https://<endpoint-api-host>/pinning/pinFile
```

For example, *pinFile* API URL of Endpoint 'Hong Kong' is:
```
https://api-hk.decoo.io/pinning/pinFile
```

## Description
Upload and pin a file to Decoo, which will also eventually be stored to Crust network.

:::note
To provide consistent programming model with [pinByHash](pinning/pin-by-hash.mdx), a *pin job* is also generated for each API call. Likewise, you can query the status of the job using [pinJobs](pinning/pin-jobs.mdx) API.

## Type
POST

## Headers
```
"UserAccessToken": "<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

## Body
The body of this request needs to take the form of a multipart/form-data with the following key / values:

**file**<br/>
The first key in the form-data body should be named "file", and the value should be the file you're attempting to upload to Decoo.
  
**decooMetadata (Optional)**

You can also include some metadata when pinning content to Decoo cloud. The metadata can later be used for easy querying on what you've pinned with [pinList](pinning/pin-list.mdx) request.

*decooMetadata* takes following form:
```json
{
  "name": "<A custom name. If not provided, the original name of the content (if feasible) will be used.>"
}
```

An example *decooMetadata* is like below:
```json
"decooOptions": {
  "name": "My File"
}
```

**cid**<br/>

IPFS CID of the file to upload. There are mutltiple approaches to get a file's IPFS CID. For example:
- IPFS Desktop. User could install [IPFS Desktop](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-desktop) or [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) locally, and call local IPFS node's [/api/v0/add](https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/http/api/#api-v0-add) HTTP API to get file CIDs (Note: When calling this API, it's suggested to set *only-hash* parameter value as *true*).
- ipfs-core. Using [ipfs-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs-core) go get a file's CID.
- Decoo SDK. Directly use [Decoo SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decooio/sdk) to get a file's CID.

**secret**<br/>

Users could use their RSA private keys to encrypt file CID to generate digital secret. For more information, please refer to related sections of [Pinning with API](/general/pinningWithApi#digital-signature).

## Response
```json
{
  "PinHash": "<This is the Ipfs multi-hash provided back for your file>",
  "PinSize": "<This is the size (in bytes) of the pinned content>",
  "PinDate": "<This is the timestamp for your content pinning (represented in ISO 8601 format)>"
}
```

## Curl Example
```sh
curl -X POST "https://api-hk.decoo.io/pinning/pinFile" \
  -H "UserAccessToken: <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@<YOUR_FILE_PATH>" \
  -F 'decooMetadata="{\"name\": \"My File\"}"' \
  -F "cid=<YOUR_FILE_CID>" \
  -F "secret=<YOUR_DIGITITAL_SIGNATURE>"
```
