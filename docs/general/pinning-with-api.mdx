## Basics

Decoo provides HTTP API to facilitate Decoo service usage. Under the *[One Cloud, Multiple Endpoints](general/architecture.mdx)* architecture, both *Decoo Cloud* and *Endpoint* are deployed with HTTP API to provide different types of services, with different authentication mechanisms. 

Specifically,
- **Decoo Cloud** provides all APIs except for file upload APIs like *pinFile* and *pinByHash*, using *API Key* for authentication.
- **Endpoint** provides file upload APIs like *pinFile* and *pinByHash*, using *OAuth2*-like mechanisms for access authorization and authentication.


## Decoo Cloud

### API Key

API Keys are used to access Decoo Cloud API. When registering an account, an API Key is automatically generated. User could login in and check their API Key at *panel* -> *API* -> *API JWT*.

Each API Key is actually a [JWT](https://jwt.io/) token which acts on behalf of the user when accessing Decoo API. Users should keep it private and never share it with others.

### Accessing API

The base url of Decoo Cloud API is: https://api.decoo.io

To authenticate with this endpoint, you need to include your API Key as an Authorization header for all your API requests in the following format:
```
"Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

You can use following curl request to test your API Key against the endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.decoo.io/ping" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

On success, it should return with 200 and the following body:
```json
{
  "Success": true
}
```

If token is invalid, it should return following body:
```json
{
  "Code": 401,
  "Message": "Invalid token"
}
```


## Endpoint

### Endpoint List

Client could request Decoo Cloud API to get Endpoint list:
```
curl -X GET "https://api.decoo.io/endpoint/list" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

It should return results like below:
```json
 [
   {
     "id": 1,
     "name": "Hong Kong",
     "apiHost": "https://api-hk.decoo.io"
   },
   ...
]
```


### Access Token

*Endpoint* use *Access Token* to authenticate user's API requests. *Access Tokens* are issued and verified by *Decoo Cloud*. The process flow is:
1. **Client** requests *Access Token* via **Decoo Cloud** API
2. **Client** calls **Endpoint** API, with the requested *Access Token* in request header
3. **Endpoint** calls **Decoo Cloud** API to verify the passed *Access Token*. If the token is valid, authenticate passes; otherwise, authenticate fails and 401 error will be returned to **Client**.

Besides, *Access Token* expires in 2 hours. Client should request a new *Access Token* if old ones expire.

To request *Access Token*ï¼š
```sh
curl -X GET "https://api.decoo.io/oauth/accessToken" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Digital Signature

When calling Endpoint's *pinFile* or *pinByHash* API, user need attach a *digital signature* as API calling proof. The *digital signature* is generated by encrypting file CID with user's RSA private key, and will be verified by Decoo Cloud using user's RSA public key.

#### RSA Keys

RSA Keys are automatically generated when registering accounts. User could login and check it at *panel* -> *API* -> *Verification Key*.

#### Calculating file CID

There are mutltiple approaches to get a file's IPFS CID. Normally, the suggested way is to install [IPFS Desktop](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-desktop) locally, and using its [/api/v0/add](https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/http/api/#api-v0-add) HTTP API to get a local file's CID (Note: When calling this API, it's suggested to set *only-hash* parameter value as *true*).

If you're building client App using JavaScript, a better suggestion is to use [ipfs-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs-core), which provides a lighter and more friendly approach to get file's CID. Actually, Decoo [Client SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decooio/sdk) uses this approach to get file CID.

#### Generating *Digital Signature*

User could refer to [pinFile](https://github.com/decooio/decoo-sdk/blob/main/packages/sdk/src/pinFile.js) of [Decoo SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decooio/sdk) about how to generate digital signature using user RSA private key and file CID, we also provide a Java version [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decooio/sdk)

### Accessing API

User must have a valid *Access Token* to access Endpoint API. Besides, to access file upload APIs like *pinFile* and *pinByHash*, a digital signature based on user RSA private key and file CID is also required.

As an example, user could use *curl* command below to access a Endpoint's *pinFile* API:

```sh
curl -X POST "https://api-hk.decoo.io/pinning/pinFile" \
  -H "UserAccessToken: <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@<YOUR_FILE_PATH>" \
  -F 'decooMetadata="{\"name\": \"My File\"}"' \
  -F "cid=<YOUR_FILE_CID>" \
  -F "secret=<YOUR_DIGITITAL_SIGNATURE>"
```

## Client SDK

As mentioned above, Decoo provides a JavaScript version [Client SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decooio/sdk), with the out of box implementation of functionalities like connecting to Endpoint, requesting *Access Token*, generating *digital signature*, etc. Users could use it to ease access Endpoint APIs. 

The SDK could be used in both NodeJS and Browser environment. Please refer to the SDK for detailed usage.
